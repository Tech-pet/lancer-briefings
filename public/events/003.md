Following the recent attack on Evergreen by unidentified local forces the lance has spent the majority of their time helping bolster the defences of Evergreen and fortify against future threats. Patience has begun including the lance on important briefings and using them as the key forces in taking tactical objectives and securing her borders against attacks. 

Patience has been having some trouble with a signal disturbing her. The investigation of such things was left to the lance with patience being due for her regular cycling and going offline for up to 24 hours.
