Following the success of the initial mission to investigate Evergreen's Distress Signal the team has had a week to kick back where they have bonded with the locals, purged infection from Heartstring's new pet, made contact with a man by the name of Templar in the local mercenaries offering future assistance for scouting and discovering an ancient carved tunnel under the industrial sector of Evergreen.

With this week's reprieve the damage to the mech's has been repaired, friends have been made and Patience the local colony NHP has invited the Lance to an intelligence Review meeting to determine the strategy for the ongoing defence and scouting capabilities of Evergreen. The Lance's attendance is requested to assist in debriefing to Edena Li and the Militia on their mission formally and to assist in target identification.
