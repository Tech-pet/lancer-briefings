Name: Olivia Smith

Call sign: Hitching Post 

Age: 26

Point of Origin: Harvest - Anamite lane 

Having grown up on a border world of mass farming industry- childhood was busy. She grew up with both parents and her 6 siblings with a never ending work life of animals, crops and siblings. 
A woman with a high work ethic, high family drive but the attitude of a rattle snake. 

Someone chasing a legacy of her great grandfather; her spirit and will to succeed pushes her forward to do what is necessary. 

Known for her laid back attitude to formality- her disregard of the rules is a recent perk of being on the bottom rung of work.
